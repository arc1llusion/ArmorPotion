Armor Potions
========================

This was a project where we decided to see how far we could get in roughly a week and a half with Microsoft XNA as the underlying engine. 

The game is meant to be a top-down dungeon crawler similar to old school Zelda games. The game was mostly functionally complete, the code is a bit of a mess, but we learned a lot doing it.
